the University of Missouri. He joined Georgia Tech Computational Science and Enginerring school and Emory University as Postdoctoral 
Fellow to work on predictive modeling in healthcare. His research included predictive modeling, relational cluster analysis, 
health and nursing informatics. He then worked for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Amazon Studios for about five years in the areas
of natural language processing (NLP), speech synthesis and some computer vision. In 2018, he helped launch [Comprehend Medical](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/), 
an Amazon web service for medical NLP.

Currently, he is an Senior Applied Scientist at Qualtrics working on conversational machine learning and active learning. He is also
an adjunct professor at Birzeit University teaching NLP related courses for doctoral students.

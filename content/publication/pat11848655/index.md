abstract: Systems, devices, and methods are provided for multi-stem volume equalization, wherein the volume levels of each stem may be adjusted non-uniformly. Audio may be diarized into a plurality of stems, including background noise separate. Mean and variance of the volume levels of the stems may be computed. Each audio stem may be automatically adjusted based on a stem-specific preference that a user may specify. View may adjust actor volume relative to the mean/variance that maintains a relative difference in volume levels between stems.
